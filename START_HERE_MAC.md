## 💡 Mac-Specific Tips

### Avoid pandas Installation Issues:

**Use Conda** (pre-compiled binaries):
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge streamlit pandas
```

**Or skip pandas** (app works without it!):
```bash
pip install streamlit python-dateutil
```

### Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)?

Use Conda - it handles ARM64 automatically:
```bash
conda create -n followup python=3.11
conda activate followup
conda install -c conda-forge streamlit pandas
```

### Intel Mac?

Same Conda approach works perfectly!

---

## 📱 iPhone/iPad Setup

After deployment:

**Add to Home Screen:**
1. Open your URL in Safari
2. Tap Share (square with arrow)
3. Select "Add to Home Screen"
4. Name: "Followups"
5. Tap "Add"

**Result:** Launches like native app with Koenig logo! 📱
